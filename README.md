# Directions on How to Run the Various Codes
This project utilizes daily federal fund rates data from 1954 to 2022, applying a range of machine learning models to forecast future rates. The data you need to run these codes is “fed_fund_rates_with_predictions.csv” and it must be located in the same folder as the code. This file is the data after preprocessing. The preprocessing attempts for handling missing values are included in files: “LSTM_missing_values” and “KNN_missing_values.” The preprocessing process can be found in the beginning of any of the following Python coding files: “SMA_Vasicek,” “SMA_Vasicek_CV,” “SMA_CIR,” and “SMA_CIR_CV.” To run these codes, you will need to have the file “fed-funds-rate-historical-chart.csv,” in the same folder as your code. “SMA_Vasicek” is the implementation of the simple moving average (SMA) approach to handle missing values with the implementation of the Vasicek model to predict future values. “SMA_Vasicek_CV” is the Vasicek model with the hyper-parameter of cross-validation (CV) implemented. This same pattern applies for “SMA_CIR” and “SMA_CIR_CV.”
